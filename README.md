# Pet-Name-Generator
A Python program for generating names for your new PET! 

To use this program, you will notice three radio buttons upon running; Dog, Cat, or Hamster.
Based on your choice of Pet type, the starting letter inputted in the entry box will choose from a list designated for that pet type. Then you will click generate and the name will be displayed below.

*NOTE* The current list is not extensive and only includes a few names, you may add more names if you like.

Additionally, to run the code, you will need to download the 'Pets.jpg' attached or you may exclude that from the code as it is only background image. 

Lastly, the entry box is not required for name generation. If a single letter is not specified, the program will simply, choose from the entire designated pet type list of names randomly.
